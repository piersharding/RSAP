== Summary

Welcome to the RSAP R module.  This module is intended to facilitate RFC calls to an SAP R/3 system of release 4.6x and above.  It may work for earlier versions but it hasn't been tested.

Prerequisites:
Please insure that YAML and reshape are installed:
install.packages(c('yaml', 'reshape'))

Installation:

install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
install_github('piersharding/RSAP', args=c("--configure-args='--with-nwrfcsdk-include=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/include --with-nwrfcsdk-lib=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib' --no-clean-on-error"))


The args= value passed in must correspond to the correct location for your setup for the INCLUDE and LIB paths to the NW RFC SDK you have installed from SAP.

Under *NIX YOU MUST MAKE SURE THAT YOU ADD THE LIB PATH TO LD_LIBRARY_PATH
EG:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/rfcsdk/lib

Or better still add this to your ldconfig (Linux) in /etc/ld.so.conf (don't forget to run ldconfig afterwards)

See the file INSTALL  (https://github.com/piersharding/RSAP/blob/master/INSTALL) for full installation instructions.

The package can be found at https://github.com/piersharding/RSAP

Examples:
See the files in the tests/ directory.
