== Summary

Welcome to the RSAP R module.  This module is intended to facilitate RFC calls to an SAP R/3 system of release 4.6x and above.  It may work for earlier versions but it hasn't been tested.

Prerequisites:
Please insure that YAML and reshape are installed:
install.packages(c('yaml', 'reshape'))

install.packages('RSAP', repos=c('http://piersharding.com/R'), configure.args=c('--with-nwrfcsdk-include=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/include --with-nwrfcsdk-lib=/home/piers/code/sap/nwrfcsdk/lib'))

The args= value passed in must correspond to the correct location for your setup for the INCLUDE and LIB paths to the NW RFC SDK you have installed from SAP.
